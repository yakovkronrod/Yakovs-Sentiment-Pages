INSTRUCTIONS
</p>
<p>
Please read the introduction pages carefully before starting. If you have any questions or comments concerning this experiment, do not hesitate to contact the experimenters. Please note that doing this experiment will take approximately 30 minutes to an hour.
</p>
<p>
You will be presented with a series of sentences, one at a time, each on its own page. Each sentence is shown 
at the top of the display. Below each sentence, you will be asked a series of questions related to the meaning 
of the sentence.
</p>
<p>
For some sentences, some questions might not sound like they make sense, or they might even sound ridiculous. 
When that is the case, use your best judgment to choose a response that reflects that impression. 
</p>
<p>
Your answers to each question will be in the form of ratings on a 1 to 7 scale, which you will select using 
radio buttons. You can use the mouse to click your choices. You can go back to a question and change your 
rating using the mouse. Click the 'Next page' button to proceed to the next sentence. Once you proceed to the next 
sentence, you cannot return to a previous one.
</p>
<p>
There will be one practice sentence to answer, and then the experiment will begin.
