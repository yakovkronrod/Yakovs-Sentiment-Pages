<tr><td>Project Title</td><td>Study of Word and Sentence Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td>Why is this research being done?</td><td>This is a study of word and sentence meaning, being conducted by Dr. Philip Resnik in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Maryland.  Its goal is to learn more about how certain kinds of words and sentences are understood.</td></tr>
<tr><td>What will I be asked to do?</td><td>You will read text and respond to questions about what is meant or implied. For example, you might be given the sentence The veterinarian fed the dog a treat and be asked questions such as How quickly would you say this happened? or How likely is it that the veterinarian chose to be involved in feeding? or Is the author in favor of giving dogs treats?  You might also be given sentences containing nonsense words, for example "The grop fed the blarg a flug" and be asked similar questions. In general, you may be asked questions that have to do with what sentences or whole documents mean or imply, what the writer's attitude is, whether text "sounds right", etc. 
<br>
In some cases, the material you look at in this study might include sentences, paragraphs, or whole documents that originated on the Web, and/or the material might include strongly worded language related to controversial topics;  you may see language or statements that I disagree with or may even find disturbing or offensive. You are free to ask questions or to withdraw from participation at any time without penalty.
<br>
You will receive a variable amount per task with a maximum of $10 for your participation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>What about confidentiality?</td><td>Basic identifying information (name and email address) will be collected. Only the investigators will have access to this data, which will be stored securely on disk drives on non-public UMD computers and kept separate from the actual data collected.  No other personally identifying information will be collected in this study and no personally identifying information will be attached to the data collected. Data collected from you in the study will be grouped with data provided by others for reporting, presentation, and use by the research community.  In any such uses, individuals would be referred to anonymously, e.g., as "Participant 1", "Participant 2", etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>What are the risks of this research?</td><td>There is no more than minimal risk that you could encounter in daily life.</td></tr>
<tr><td>What are the benefits of this research?</td><td>There are no personal benefits to you in this research, other than the satisfaction of contributing to scientific knowledge about language. The overall benefit of the project is an improved understanding of how interpretations of lexical, phrasal, and sentential meanings are influenced by the syntax of the sentence, including better predictions about how people will react to what they read.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Do I have to be in this research? May I stop participating at any time?</td><td>Your participation in this research is completely voluntary.  You may choose not to take part at all.  If you decide to participate in this research, you may stop participating at any time for any reason.  If you decide not to participate in this study or if you stop participating at any time, you will not be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify.</td></tr>
